/*
Functional Objects  :   def1 -> objects of any class that supports operator()
                    :   def2 -> the object to which a function pointer refers

NOTE:
wherever a functional object is expected a function pointer will also work 

TYPES:
1. Binary functional objects    :   correspond to binary operators, plus
2. Unary functional objects     :   corresponds to unary opertors, like logical_not, negation   

<functional> is a header file which contains common functional objects
